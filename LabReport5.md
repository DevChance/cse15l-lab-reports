# **✨ Welcome to my Lab Report #5 ✨** 

Written by: Chance Spurlin

#### **In this lab report we will utilize a bash script to complete the tasks from Lab Report 4; This will greatly reduce the time and effort needed to complete the tasks**

## To do this we will be completing these **6 steps**

**1. Log into ieng6**

**2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**

**3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**

**4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test**

**5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed**

**6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)**







## Let's first begin by starting at the terminal:

# Now Lets Complete Each of The Six Steps:

## Step One: Log into ieng6

**1. First, we must log into the ieng6 server. To do this, we type `ssh cs15lwi23___@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

**2. You will then be prompted to enter your password, after you enter your password press `<ENTER>`**
